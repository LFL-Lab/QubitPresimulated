# Final Product Directory
All final simulation results will be appended to here. DO NOT DELETE THESE.

Draft simulation will go into `../draft_presimulated`

## Naming Convention
Files will be named as `{QComponent}_{Simulation Method}.csv`

Example: For `TransmonCross.py` simulated via `EPRanalysis`, we'll store the resulting parameters as `TransmonCross_EPR.csv`
