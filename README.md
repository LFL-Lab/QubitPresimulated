# QubitPresimulated
Library of premade qubits made in Qiskit Metal. Ask for a set of target parameters, and we'll give you a few close choices.

## To Do
1. Make a few base classes which outline how to select
  -  `Library`
      - .csv of all the qubits we've simulated 
  -  `QubitSelector`
      - Input: Target parameters associated w/ the qubit, and style of qubit
      - Output: Dictionary of qubit options (in the format of qiskit metal)
